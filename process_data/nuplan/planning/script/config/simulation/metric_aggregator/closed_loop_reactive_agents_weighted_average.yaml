    ego_progress_along_expert_route: 5.0 # This metric has the highest weight equal to 5.0 in the weighted average function, its base score can take a value in [0,1] depending on the ratio of ego to expert progress
    time_to_collision_within_bound: 5.0 # This metric has the highest weight equal to 5.0 in the weighted average function, its base score can be 0 or 1 depending on the minimum time to collision threshold
    speed_limit_compliance: 4.0 # This metric has a weight equal to 4.0 in the weighted average function, its base score can take a value in [0,1] depending on the amount and duration of over-speeding
    ego_is_comfortable: 2.0 # This metric has the lowest weight equal to 2.0 in the weighted average function, its base score can be 0 or 1 depending on the comfort thresholds on acceleration, jerk and yaw.

  # The scenario score is defined as the weighted average score of the metrics listed above, multiplied by the score of the multiple_metrics below.
  multiple_metrics:
    - no_ego_at_fault_collisions # This metric score can be 0, 0.5 or 1 depending on whether there is an at fault collision with VRUs, vehicles or objects
    - drivable_area_compliance # This metric score can be 0 or 1 depending on whether ego drives outside the drivable area
    - ego_is_making_progress # This metric score can be 0 or 1 depending on whether ego makes progress more than a minimum threshold compared to expert's progress
    - driving_direction_compliance # This metric score can be 0 or 0.5 or 1 depending on how much ego drives in the opposite direction if any
